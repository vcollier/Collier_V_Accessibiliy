    <p>Come on Eileen
                 <br>
                Come on Eileen
                <br>
                Poor old Johnny Ray
                <br>
                Sounded sad upon the radio
                <br>
                He moved a million hearts in mono
                <br>
                Our mothers used
                <br>
                To sing along, who'd blame them
                <br>
                You're grown (a grown up),
                <br>
                So grown (so grown up), now I must say more than ever
                <br>
                (Come on Eileen)
                <br>
                Toora loora toora loo rye aye
                <br>
                And we can sing just like our fathers
                <br>
                Come on Eileen, oh I swear (well he means)
                <br>
                At this moment, you mean everything
                <br>
                You in that dress, oh my thoughts I confess
                <br>
                Verge on dirty
                <br>
                Ah come on Eileen
                <br>
                Come on Eileen
                <br>
                These people round here
                <br>
                Wear beaten down eyes
                <br>
                Sunk in smoke dried faces
                <br>
                Resigned to what their fate is
                <br>
                But not us (no never), no not us (no never)
                <br>
                We are far too young and clever
                <br>
                Remember
                <br>
                Toora loora toora loo rye aye
                <br>
                Eileen I'll hum this tune forever
                <br>
                Eileen I'll hum this tune forever
                <br>
                Come on Eileen oh I swear (well he means)
                <br>
                Ah come on, let's take off everything
                <br>
                That pretty red dress, oh Eileen tell him yes
                <br>
                Ah come on let's, Ah come on Eileen
                <br>
                Come on Eileen oh I swear (well he means)
                <br>
                At this moment you mean everything
                <br>
                Come on Eileen too-loo rye-aye
                <br>
                Come on Eileen too-loo rye-aye
                <br>
                Toora toora-too-loora
                <br>
                Oh, Eileen
                <br>
                Oh, Eileen
                <br>
                We are far too young and clever
                <br>
                And things wont ever change
                <br>
                I say toora loora toora loo rye aye
                <br>
                Come on Eileen, oh I swear (well he means)
                <br>
                At this moment, you mean everything to me
                <br>
                You mean everything</p>
